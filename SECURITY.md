At **Kodierung**, we take security seriously. This document outlines the steps for reporting security vulnerabilities and our approach to handling security issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in **Kodierung**, please **do not** report it through public GitHub issues or discussions. Instead, follow the instructions below to privately report the issue:

   - Any other relevant information, such as severity or impact.
   
2. **Subject Line**: Please include `SECURITY: Kodierung - [brief issue description]` in the subject line of the email, so that we can prioritize your report accordingly.

3. **Confidentiality**: We will treat your report with confidentiality and work with you to address the issue as quickly as possible. We will not share the details of your report until a fix is implemented and deployed.

## Security Response Process

Once your report is received, we will follow this process:
1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of the report within 48 hours.
2. **Assessment**: We will assess the severity of the vulnerability and prioritize it based on the potential risk to users and the system.
3. **Fix and Testing**: We will work to fix the issue and perform thorough testing to ensure no other security risks are introduced.
4. **Disclosure**: After the fix is deployed, we will disclose the vulnerability responsibly, typically in the form of a GitHub security advisory.
