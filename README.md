### This is in a very early stage of development and will take quite some time to be finished. If you see some problems and want to give some tips they are very much appreciated, but pull-requests (likely) won't be accepted until the first version of the website is (almost) finished. This is because this repository is mainly a learning opportunity for me so for now I want to write as much of the code as possible myself.

### During the development of the base site, this README will remain largely empty. After base development is done, the empty chapters will be filled.
