<h1 align="center">✨ A very purple in-browser IDE, connected to GitHub 👾</h1>

### This is in a very early stage of development and will take quite some time to be finished. Tips/discussions are very much appreciated, but pull-requests won't be accepted until the first version of the website is (almost) finished.
### During the development of the base site, this README will remain largely empty. After base development is done, the empty chapters will be filled.
