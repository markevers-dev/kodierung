<h1 align="center">✨ A very purple in-browser IDE, connected to GitHub 👾</h1>

### This is in a very early stage of development and will take quite some time to be finished. Tips/discussions are very much appreciated, but pull-requests won't be accepted until the first version of the website is (almost) finished.
### During the development of the base site, this README will primarily be used to track TODO's. After this development is done, the empty chapters will be filled.

## TODO List:
- Refactor code to have reusable components, primarily Typography and the Kodierung Logo (for now)
- Upgrade to Next.js 15.1.0
- Use NextAuth for GitHub authentication
- Implement the overview and selection of repositories
- Find a way to store these files so they can be edited in the browser
- Add the Monaco Editor
- Handle saving/commiting/pushing
- Give the homepage a makeover and write an About Us page/section
- Write proper metadata/sitemap/robots.txt
